	about: {
		title: "Who am I?",
		description:
			"My name is Jillian Nylund and I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the Unversity of Illinois from Lynchburg, Virginia. I am planning on graduating in December 2025. My interest in Computer Science stems from an initial love of problem-solving. Beginning with the block coding of Scratch, I am entranced by the sheer power, complexity, and ability of putting various pieces of code together to solve a problem. Right now, my interests are in the realm of full-stack development, however I want to explore new fields. Another reasons I love computer science is how large the field is and how many different things you can do in it. I am also passionate about making sure the CS is accessible to all, especially females. I pursue this by participating in Girls Who Code and Women in Computer Science here at UIUC. Outside of class, I enjoy ice skating, reading, and playing with my cats :)",
